# Exercise 2: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored the first 4 games of last season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores 2016")
points <- c(12, 3, 37, 27)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games
points.allowed <- c(10, 9, 18, 17)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
data <- data.frame(points, points.allowed)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
data$diff <- data$points - data$points.allowed

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom
data$won <- data$diff > 0

# Create a vector of the opponents
opponents <- c('Dolphins', 'Rams', '49ers', 'Jets')

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
